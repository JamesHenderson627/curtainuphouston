CURTAIN UP HOUSTON

Curtain Up Houston is a project designed to make searching for community theatres in Houston fast and easy. It is also meant to be a convenient platform for community theatres to promote themselves to the public.

Currently you can search for theatres by inputting a zipcode or using your current location.

Theatres can create a profile page that immediatlely becomes searchable.

Future updates to include further customization of theatre profile pages.
