CURTAIN UP HOUSTON

Curtain Up Houston is a project designed to make searching for community theatres in Houston fast and easy. It is also meant to be a convenient platform for community theatres to promote themselves to the public.

Uses Yelp API to search for theatres not currently in the database, Google Maps and goelocation API search for theatres closest to your location, and Parse for online database.

Currently you can search for theatres by inputting a zipcode or using your current location.

Theatres can create a profile page that immediatlely becomes searchable.

Future updates to include further customization of theatre profile pages.
